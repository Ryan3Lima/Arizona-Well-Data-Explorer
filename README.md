# Arizona Well Data Explorer ðŸ’§
Welcome to the interactive groundwater data explorer for Arizona. This app utilizes data from the 2024 GWSI well database.

This app allows you to:

* Visualize groundwater well depths and water level elevations.
* Explore well characteristics by region, aquifer, and geology.
* Overlay hydrologic features like Subbasins, AMAs, and Major Aquifers.
* Use the dropdowns to filter wells, and view 3D depth profiles and geographic maps.
